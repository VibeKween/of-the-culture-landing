# Session Handoff Generator Guide

## How to Generate Session Handoffs

### At the End of Each Development Session

**Step 1: Create Next Session Handoff**
1. Copy the `SESSION-HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md` 
2. Replace all template variables with current project information
3. Save as `SESSION-[NEXT-NUMBER]-HANDOFF.md` in project's docs folder
4. Include in final commit of current session

**Step 2: Update Building in Public Content**
1. Create session summary in `docs/building-in-public/session-summaries/`
2. Use the session summary template for consistency
3. Update progress and milestones as needed

**Step 3: Commit Everything**
1. Add handoff file to git
2. Commit with descriptive message including handoff creation
3. Push to repository

### Template Variables Quick Reference

**Basic Information:**
- `[PROJECT NAME]` → "the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce microsite"
- `[XXX]` → Next session number (002, 003, etc.)
- `[SESSION FOCUS DESCRIPTION]` → Brief focus description

**URLs and Paths:**
- `[GITHUB REPOSITORY URL]` → Full GitHub URL
- `[LIVE SITE URL]` → Live deployment URL  
- `[LOCAL PROJECT PATH]` → Local filesystem path

**Session Planning:**
- `[FOCUS AREA X]` → 5-6 specific focus areas for next session
- `[COMPLETED ITEM X]` → 3-4 major completed items
- `[SUCCESS CRITERIA X]` → 5-6 specific success criteria
- `[ACTION DESCRIPTION]` → What session should start with

### Project-Specific Templates

For ongoing projects, consider creating project-specific templates that pre-fill common information:

**Example for OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce:**
```
[PROJECT NAME] → "the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce microsite"
[GITHUB REPOSITORY URL] → "https://github.com/VibeKween/of-the-culture-ecommerce"
[LIVE SITE URL] → "https://vibekween.github.io/of-the-culture-ecommerce/"
[LOCAL PROJECT PATH] → "/Users/falonbahal/Desktop/DEVELOPMENT/TUKU-GROUP/03-ECOMMERCE-OF-THE-CULTURE"
```

### Integration with Development Process

**Documentation Standards:**
- Every session should end with handoff creation
- Handoff files become part of project documentation
- Include handoff creation in session completion checklists

**Quality Assurance:**
- Test that all links work before ending session
- Verify documentation paths are correct
- Ensure success criteria are specific and measurable

### Automation Opportunities

**Future Enhancements:**
- Script to auto-generate handoffs with current project info
- Integration with git hooks to remind about handoff creation
- Template validation to check all variables are replaced

**Claude Integration:**
- Include handoff generation in Claude's end-of-session checklist
- Standardize handoff creation as part of session completion
- Use handoffs to maintain context across different Claude instances

## Benefits of This System

**Continuity:** Seamless transitions between development sessions
**Context Preservation:** All necessary information captured and accessible
**Efficiency:** New sessions start immediately with full context
**Documentation:** Handoffs become part of project historical record
**Team Onboarding:** Anyone can pick up development with clear handoffs
**Quality Control:** Structured format ensures nothing important is missed
